# Bitwig Extensions of klingt.net

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klingtnet/bitwig-extensions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klingtnet/bitwig-extensions)

This is a collection of my custom controller extensions, previously called scripts, for Bitwig.

## Instructions

The installation is super easy, either you use the precompiled extensions from the [github release page][releases] or you build it yourself, give GNU Make, Maven and Java8+ is available:

```sh
$ make install
```

## Troubleshooting

I only tested the extensions under Linux, so if does not automatically detect them please [open up an issue][issues] and tell me the names of the MIDI controller's ports as shown in Bitwig's controller menu.
